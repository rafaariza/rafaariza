Forwardslash starts off like most classic Hack The Box machines with some enumeration of vhosts, files and directories with gobuster then we use a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to reach a protected dev directory only accessible from localhost. After finding credentials and getting a shell, we'll analyze and exploit a small backup program to read files as user pain and find more credentials. In the spirit of Team Unintended, instead of solving the crypto challenge to get root I used the sudo commands available to me to upload and mount my own Luks container and execute a SUID bash binary.

## Summary

- Find the `backup` vhost, create an account and log in to the dashboard
- Enumerate the `backup` vhost with gobuster, find a `/dev` directory that only allows connections from localhost
- Use the disabled change profile picture page to do an SSRF and access the `/dev` directory, finding the `chiv` user password
- SSH in as user `chiv`, reverse a backup utitity and write a script to compute the expected MD5 hash, gaining arbitrary file read as user `pain`
- Find the password for user `pain` in `/var/backups/config.php.bak`
- Gain root the unintended way by using the sudo `luksOpen` and `mount` commands to mount a volume where a SUID `/bin/bash` binary has been placed

## Portscan

```python
# Python Program to find the area of triangle

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
```
